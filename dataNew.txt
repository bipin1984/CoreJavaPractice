Lines of the file are:Reading Files in java with two main classes 	1. FileReader : 		1) for text files found in local system..	   	text files found in server etc.	    2) FileReader should usually be wrapped in a BufferedFileReader.	       this saves up the data so that we can deal it a line at time	       or by character by character 	       	   	2. FileInputStream: for both text and binary file that contain weird charactersWriting a Files in java:	The logic is completely same but only difference is for a text file 	we should use FileWriter and BufferedFileWriter for text file
